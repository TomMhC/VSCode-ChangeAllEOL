# Change All End Of Line Sequence

This extension uses the built-in command 'Change End Of Line Sequence' to change the line ending (LF or CRLF) of all files of a specified type(s) in the Visual Studio Code workspace.


## Usage

* WARNING: Currently there is NO WAY to abort the process, it won't actually save any changes automatically but it can take some time, sorry, please check the number of files first.
* Open the command pallette (CTRL+SHIFT+P) and type "Change All End Of Line Sequence".
* You will be asked for the file types that should have their line endings changed (directories starting with '.' are ignored).
* You will be asked what line ending you want for those files.
* It will open and change all the files but they are NOT automatically saved.
